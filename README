Welcome to my humble space
==========================

The first thing about this page is this page doesn't exist. :)

Second, feel free to fork this off and submit pull requests!

Third, all of these are at your risk. I use all the scripts on here, but YMMV

Fourth, I will support these scripts should there be any issues. Just email me

Fifth, these are developed and tested on Google Chrome. I do not have the time to test on FireFox or Safari. I will take bug reports, but issues on chrome will no doubt be fixed faster than any other browser.

Sixth, I do take suggestions, so please feel free to send me one

------

classifyFromQueue.js: Adds "Not a defect" links to tickets waiting to be classified from the queue in the handler spot (since we know that)

fb.user.js: Removes the fogbugz section

sticky.user.js: Sticks the main menu on top, integrates very well with the timeclock bar

tweaks.user.js: The core of this page. Allows you to do a multitude of things with the ticket system, specificly reguarding coloring. Docs to come when I have time.

SmallerPachaNotes.js: Decreases the size of Pacha notes to make the ticket just a tad bit shorter. Credit: David Nielson
